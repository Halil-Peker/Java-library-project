# Java-library-project
This study is my 2nd semester (2020) project at the university. It is written in Java language. Our project is a library project. It includes features such as registering, selecting a book, adding the book to the "book list", borrowing a book. We did this project with my project friend Faruk Önder Beyazıt.
